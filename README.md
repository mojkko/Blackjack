# Simple Blackjack Game

Welcome to Simple Blackjack Game, a straightforward implementation of the classic card game built using JavaScript, HTML, and a touch of CSS. This project aims to provide a simple yet enjoyable experience for playing Blackjack right in your web browser.

## How to Play

1. **Getting Started:**
   - Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
   - Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

2. **Game Rules:**
   - The goal of Blackjack is to have a hand value that is closer to 21 than the dealer's hand, without exceeding 21.
   - Each player is initially dealt two cards. Numbered cards are worth their face value, face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10, and Aces can be worth either 1 or 11, depending on what's favorable.
   - After the initial deal, players can choose to "hit" (receive another card) or "stand" (keep their current hand).

3. **Game Interface:**
   - You'll see your cards and the dealer's card on the screen.
   - Buttons for "Hit" and "Stand" will be available for you to make your move.

4. **Winning and Losing:**
   - If your hand value exceeds 21, you "bust" and lose the round.
   - If the dealer busts or has a lower hand value than you, you win the round.
   - If the dealer's hand is closer to 21 than yours, you lose the round.
   - If both you and the dealer have the same hand value, it's a "push," and you neither win nor lose.

5. **Restarting the Game:**
   - After each round, you'll have the option to restart the game to play again.
